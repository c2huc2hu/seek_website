Hello anyone looking at the source,

This is my first website built from scratch, using HTML, JS, jQuery and CSS, because 
I was bored and decided to learn those languages. I probably used a bunch of poor
practices, so apologies if you have to maintain this. There might be compatibility 
issues, I'm not sure, but it works on chrome, so I'm happy.

        function callback() { init(); }; 
        // we want the init file inside site_theme, so we wait until we load the file before 
        // using the callback. kind of hack but oh well
