Hello anyone looking at the source,

This is my first website built from scratch, using HTML, JS, jQuery and CSS, because 
I was bored and decided to learn those languages. I probably used a bunch of poor
practices, so apologies if you have to maintain this. There might be compatibility 
issues, I'm not sure, but it works on chrome, so I'm happy.
