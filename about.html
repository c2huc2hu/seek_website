        SEEK is an annual competition hosted by Robotics for Space Exploration (RSX). 
        Competitors are given a task, some robotic components to design and build a robot to 
        complete a series of challenges. SEEK was first held in 2015 as a way of getting more 
        people interested and active in robotics. We'd have to say we were pretty successful!

        About RSX
        </h2> 
        <p>
        RSX (Robotics for Space Exploration) was founded in 2013 to represent the University of Toronto 
        at the University Rover Challenge. Since then, we've added a couple more projects: Cansat, which 
        develops a rocket payload, and a High Altitude Balloon, that takes sensor readings of the atmosphere. 
        As a new club, we pride ourselves on our openness to new members regardless of skill or experience. 
        If you're interested, feel free to contact us at contact [at] rsx-utoronto.ca, and checkout our website!
