<h2> In a galaxy far, far away ... </h2> 
<p> 
After Earth's Planetary Defense Unit (PDU) defeated the Zeitans (originating from the Metapod-62A star cluster) 
last year during SEEK 2015, the Earthlings began excavating the elusive unobtanium-243 reserves on Mars. 
Everything seemed to be going great, they even employed some willing Zeitans to sweep the space junk in Mars' orbit. 
However, just last week an Earthling posted at Site 74B near the south pole of Mars reported abnormally high and 
periodic radiation bursts coming from below the surface. No natural phenomenon could explain this activity. 
The PDU's best scientists were able to determine that the radiation bursts were actually highly directive 
homing signals being sent to a second and previously unknown Zeitan colony located somewhere in the Butterfree-89Y 
star cluster! Upon decrypting the signal, the PDU also figured out that the Zeitan colony would arrive within six 
months with a much larger army, too large for the Earthlings to defeat. Instead of shutting down the transmission, 
the PDU decided to trick the incoming Zeitans by modifying the signal and redirecting them towards a black hole 
instead of Mars. Reaching the transmitter wouldn't be easy, so a robotic system would be needed to perform the 
mission. The robot would be required to complete a number of tasks by remote control. Your mission, should you 
choose to accept it, is to assemble a team of three engineers (including yourself) to build this robot for the 
PDU, and save the solar system! </p>
