        <h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2> 
        <p> We'll be adding questions as they come in, so feel free to send them to contact [at] rsx-utoronto.com or post to the SEEK Facebook event </p> 
        
        <h3> Is there a dress code for SEEK? </h3> 
        <p> Absolutely not. Volunteers should wear RSX shirts/ light blue. </p> 
        
        <h3> Can I use materials other than what we were given? </h3> 
        <p> You may bring tools, but not materials, so they should not end up on the robot. </p> 
        
        <h3> Where are some good tutorials for Arduino? </h3> 
        <p> The <a href="www.arduino.cc">Arduino website</a> is a good place to start. The examples are all pretty good and well documented. </p>
        
        <h3> I have an iPhone/ Mac. What can I use? </h3>
        <p> We know for sure that Blueterm works on Android phones. There are alternatives for iOS and computers, but we don't know which ones work well. 
        The Arduino IDE works on some Macs, but we've had the most success with Windows and Linux respectively. Using a VM can work, but is inconsistent, 
        so dual-booting is better. The more laptops you bring, the more likely success. </p>
